# reduce()

# syntax

# reduce(function,iterable)

# combines all items into one final value

# it must be imported from functools

from functools import reduce

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]

print(reduce(lambda a,b:a + b,numbers))

# a,b with first two values

# a = 1, b = 2

# previous result with next value

# a = 3, b = 3

# previous result with next value

# a = 6, b = 4
